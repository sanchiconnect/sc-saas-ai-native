# SanchiSaaS — Module Map (Cross-Repo Reference)

**Document type:** Internal architecture reference.
**Companion documents:** `CLAUDE.md` (blast-radius graph + 6 cross-repo invariants), `specs/SanchiSaaS-Repo-Map.md` (repo-level purpose/owns/depends-on), each repo's own `specs/<repo>-module-specs-index.md` (full detail + security findings per module — this document summarizes and cross-links them, it does not replace them).

**Purpose:** Answer four questions in one place — (1) what stack does each repo run, (2) what does every module in every repo actually do, (3) which modules, specifically, talk to which modules in other repos and how, and (4) who — which user/role — can actually access each repo and each piece of functionality in it.

---

## Part A — How the seven repos connect

```
sanchiconnect-saas-tenants (cockpit / control plane — highest blast radius)
        │  verify_tenant / tenant-settings          │  bootstrap config
        ▼                                            ▼
sc-saas-frontend (end-user PWA)            sc-saas-backend (business API)
        │ business calls via apiUrl                  │                    │
        └────────────────────────────────────────────┘                    │ SMS/email/video/chat/url/docs
                                                                            ▼
sc-saas-admin (accelerator staff panel)                    sc-saas-3rdparty-webservices (integration gateway)
        │ api_server_url REST → backend
        │ reads tenant DB directly → tenants
        │ score runs, HTTP → ai-startups-analyzer

sanchiconnect-saas-tenants-admin (platform operator UI)
        │ reads + writes tenants DB directly (shared DB, no API)
        │ unconditional PATCH → backend on every tenant edit

sc-saas-backend ──x-hostname + JWT──▶ power-pitch-sanchiconnect-api (external, SanchiPowerpitch workspace)
```

Solid edges are live runtime calls. `tenants` ↔ `tenants-admin` and `admin` → `tenants` are direct shared-database reads/writes, bypassing any API — a schema change on either side can break the other with no compile-time warning. See `CLAUDE.md`'s full blast-radius graph and 6 invariants for the authoritative version of this diagram; the rest of this document works one level below it, at module granularity.

## Part B — Per-repo stack & module inventory

### 1. `sanchiconnect-saas-tenants` — Control plane / cockpit

**Stack:** NestJS 9 · TypeORM 0.3 · MySQL (single shared DB, row-per-tenant) · npm · Node 16+
**Role:** Source of truth for feature-flag names and tenant/workspace provisioning. Highest blast radius in the workspace — a change here can reach `frontend`, `admin`, and (via `backend`) everything backend touches, plus `tenants-admin` via direct shared-DB access.

| Module | Purpose / Goal / Description |
|---|---|
| `core` (bootstrap) | NestJS bootstrap (helmet, CORS, Swagger), env validation, TypeORM factory, `TransformInterceptor`, `@ClientDomainHeader`, global exception filter. |
| `tenants` | `TenantUsersEntity` — 150+ flag/config columns; **the cross-repo contract source of truth** for every feature flag in the platform; also `TenantMaintenanceEntity`. |
| `global` | Entry point / pre-auth bootstrap surface every other repo calls before a JWT exists. All 5 routes — including `verify_tenant` and `tenant-settings` — are confirmed unauthenticated. |
| `global` → `global-verification` | `verify_tenant/:hostname` + `tenant-settings/:hostname` — the frozen tenant-verification contract; frontend and backend both bootstrap from this. |
| `global` → `global-system` | Currency exchange rates, system messages, program-promotion + tracking endpoints, SaaS leads, global settings. |
| `global` → `global-admin` | 22 `spa_*` TypeORM entities — schema definitions for admin-panel config tables; NestJS owns the schema, PHP (`tenants-admin`) writes the rows directly. |
| `organizations` | Billing org entity — invoices, payments, contacts, contracts. Only `name` is non-nullable; `tenant_users.organization_id` requires a pre-existing row here before a tenant can be provisioned. |
| `subscriptions` | Subscription lifecycle — links an organization to a plan; expiry has tenant-access implications. |
| `ai-credits` | Prepaid AI-credit wallet/ledger schema. Implements only the **purchase path** (catalog, Easebuzz order + webhook, GST invoicing) — one of three independent writers to the shared `ai_credit_*` tables (see Part C, thread 6). |
| `ecosystem` | Multi-tenant profile directory — 8 entity types (startups, investors, mentors, corporates, partners, service providers, individuals, program-office members), populated by best-effort sync from per-tenant backends. |
| `ip-management` | Patents + IP-connect requests (IP hub); facility bookings (facility hub). PHP admin panels write directly to these tables. |
| `ecosystem-facilities` | Facility directory (list/detail/types) — GET-only public endpoints, domain-scoped, no auth guard. |

---

| `zoho` (`core/`) | One-way outbound sync of stakeholders + activity into Zoho CRM — **independent of, and unrelated to, `sc-saas-admin`'s own `zoho` module** (see Part C, thread 10). |
| `upload-module` (`core/`) | Shared internal provider centralizing all S3 file I/O plus an HTML→PDF renderer, consumed by ~25 feature modules. |
| `sockets` (`core/`) | Single Socket.IO gateway — the only real-time push channel (unread counts, typing indicators, presence). |
| `portfolio-management` | 8 entities, zero controller/service — schema consumed by the PHP admin via direct DB access. |

### 7. `sanchiconnect-saas-tenants-admin` — Platform operator UI

**Stack:** PHP ≥5.5 · Composer · Medoo · sparkAdminTpl (QUCod) · **one DB connection** — the shared tenants MySQL DB (same DB `sanchiconnect-saas-tenants` owns)
**Role:** Used by Sanchi's own platform-operator staff (not tenant/accelerator staff) to provision tenants, manage roles, and administer global cockpit data. Distinct from, and unrelated to, `sc-saas-admin` despite the similar name. 9 of 9 module directories spec'd.

| Module | Purpose / Goal / Description |
|---|---|
| core (root-level) | `index.php` routing, `config/`, `core/db.php` + `session.php`, `includes/core_functions.php`, and the generic `add.php`/`edit.php`/`table.php`/`detail.php` engine over the tenants DB. |

| `auth` | Login, session-based RBAC, operator profile, admin/role/partner account CRUD — notifies `sc-saas-backend` on new-admin creation. |
| `developer` | Platform config tools — API route registry, email/settings/menu/form-field/form-layout/table-view management, per-tenant data export. |
| `ai_credits` | Operator screens for the AI-credits commercial catalogue — packages, per-task rates, one-off tenant grants, cross-tenant read-only orders view. One of three independent writers to the shared `ai_credit_*` tables (see Part C, thread 6). |
| `finance_management` | **The platform's own billing of tenants** for AI-credits purchases — GST/VAT tax profiles, invoice supplier settings, read-only invoice register. Not related to `sc-saas-admin`'s member-facing `finance_management`. |
| `aws` | Raw S3 bucket manager ("Files Storage" screen). |
| `filemanager` | Local-disk file browser over the admin server's own filesystem. |
| `csv` | Generic table-driven CSV export/import for the dynamic CRUD engine — any table, by name. |
| `upload` | TinyMCE rich-text image-upload endpoint. |
| `modules/scrapper.php` (standalone file, not a subdirectory) | Reads across every tenant's DB directly for platform-level reporting — unrelated in purpose to `sc-saas-admin`'s own `scrapper` module of the same name (see Part C, "Same name, unrelated" callout). |

## Part C — Cross-repo module connections

This is the synthesis the per-repo indexes don't show on their own: which specific module in one repo talks to which specific module in another, and by what mechanism.

### 1. Feature flags — the platform's most-propagated contract
`tenants` → `tenants` module (`TenantUsersEntity` boolean columns, ~218 of them) is the single source of truth.
**Consumers:** `backend`'s `Feature` enum + `feature-guard.ts` (`core/constants/enum.ts`) · `frontend`'s `IFeatures` (`core/domain/brand.model.ts`) · `admin`'s `config.php` constants. A column rename must propagate to all three simultaneously, or a flag silently stops gating in one client while still gating in another.

### 2. Tenant verification / bootstrap
`tenants` → `global`/`global-verification` module (`verify_tenant/:hostname`, `tenant-settings/:hostname`) is called by:

- `backend`'s core-bootstrap, at process startup, to load per-tenant config (DB creds, `api_url`, secrets).
- `frontend`'s `core` module (`GlobalService`, `brand.model.ts`) to resolve `apiUrl` before any business call.

One-directional, `tenants` upstream of both. Confirmed unauthenticated on the `tenants` side — anyone who can reach it and knows a hostname gets the same plaintext secrets both consumers receive.

### 3. Business API contract
`backend`'s ~58 `src/modules/*` controllers/DTOs (`api/v{n}`) are consumed by:

- `frontend`'s `core/service/*` layer, via the `apiUrl` resolved in thread 2.
- `admin`, via `api_server_url` cURL calls scattered across most modules.
- `tenants-admin`, via two specific, direct, unconditional calls: `modules/edit.php` → `PATCH .../saas/settings` (`resetAPISaaSSettings()`, fires on every `tenant_users` edit) and `modules/auth/admins.php` → `admin-account-created/:token` (conditional, on new-admin creation).

### 4. Third-party integration gateway
`backend`'s `core/services/*.service.ts` files call `sc-saas-3rdparty-webservices` modules 1:1 — see the table in Part B §6. Consuming backend feature modules: `auth`/`verifications` (sms), most notification-sending modules (sendGrid/ses), `chat`/`conversations` (cometChat), `meetings` (videoSDK), connection-request flows across many modules (shortIo), `startup`/pitch-deck flows (convertKit).
**Documented exception:** `admin`'s `meetings` module calls the 3rdparty gateway **directly** for VideoSDK session lookups, bypassing `backend` entirely — the only confirmed non-backend caller of that service.

### 5. AI scoring pipeline
`admin`'s `application_management`/`jury` modules → HTTP → `ai-startups-analyzer`'s `scoring-engine`. Analyzer never calls back; admin polls for results. The 0–500→1–5 scale (`_coerce_rating` in the analyzer, `decimal(4,3)` column in the backend schema consumed by `admin`) is a frozen contract — changing it on one side without the other silently corrupts scores.

### 6. AI Credits — three independent, non-synchronized writers
The same `ai_credit_*` tables in the shared tenants DB are written by three separate modules with **no shared validation layer**:

- `tenants` → `ai-credits` module — purchase path only (catalog, Easebuzz order + webhook, invoicing).
- `admin` → `ai_credits` module — wallet/buy/history UI (calls `tenants`' `v1/ai-credits/purchase`); reserve/settle/refund spend-side logic lives in `includes/ai_credits_functions.php`, invoked from `application_management`.
- `tenants-admin` → `ai_credits` module — operator-side catalogue management (packages, task-rates, grants) + a cross-tenant, read-only orders view.

See `specs/features/FT-005-ai-credits-system.spec.md` for the full architecture and the risk this fragmentation creates.

### 7. Shared tenants DB — direct access, no API

- `tenants-admin` — the entire application reads/writes `tenant_users`, `organizations`, and every `spa_*` table directly (its `core`, `ai_credits`, `finance_management`, `developer/data_export.php`, and standalone `modules/scrapper.php` all touch this DB with no NestJS intermediary).
- `admin` — several specific modules cross into the tenants DB directly rather than going through `backend`: `growth_metrics` (`metric_types.php` writes), `finance-memberships`'s `settings.php`, `outreach_requests` (`program_promotions` table — see thread 9), `intellectual_property` (`patents` table), `facilities` (dual-DB soft-delete write), and its own `scrapper` module's `list.php` (reads **every** tenant's DB with no scoping to the current tenant — a known finding, not by design).

### 8. Ecosystem directory (cross-tenant profile sharing)
`backend`'s `ecosystem` module proxies profile search/sync to `tenants`' `ecosystem` module (8 entity types, best-effort). `frontend`'s `search`/`global-search-page` are the UI surface on top of this chain.

### 9. Program promotions / outreach
`admin`'s `outreach_requests` module reads/writes the `program_promotions` table, which lives in the **shared tenants DB**, not the per-tenant client DB — the same table `tenants`' `global-system` module exposes via its `program-promotion-tracking` endpoint (itself consumed by `backend`'s `sanchiconnect.service.ts`).

### 10. Zoho — same name, no shared contract (documented gotcha)
`backend`'s `zoho` (`core/zoho`) and `admin`'s `zoho` module are **two entirely independent CRM integrations** — different code, different sync logic, no shared table or contract. Do not assume a change in one affects the other; this is called out explicitly as a workspace-wide guardrail because the naming collision invites exactly that mistake.

### 11. External cross-workspace: PowerPitch
`backend`'s `power-pitch-module` calls `power-pitch-sanchiconnect-api`'s `/v1/externals/*` endpoints (SanchiPowerpitch workspace, external to this repo folder) via `PowerPitchExternalService` — tenant identity via `x-hostname` header, session token cached/refreshed 10 min before JWT expiry. `frontend`'s `pitch-deck-management` module is the UI surface for this integration's "live video" mode. PowerPitch never calls back into any SanchiSaaS repo.

### 12. Same-feature, three-repo pairs (authoring in admin, delivery via backend, display in frontend)
Several features exist as a matched trio — an admin authoring/management module, a backend module that owns the contract, and a frontend display module:

| Feature | Admin module | Backend module | Frontend module |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resource library | `resource-files` | `resources` | `resources` |
| Glossary | `glossary` | `glossary` | `glossary` |
| Support tickets | `tickets` | `tickets` | `tickets` |
| Learning management | `learning_management` | `learning-management` | `learning-management` |
| Certificates / ID cards | `certificates`, `certificate_builders`, `id_card_builders`, `id_cards` | `certificates`, `id-cards` | `cerificates`, `sc-certificate-renderer`, `sc-id-card-renderer` |
| Growth metrics / milestones | `growth_metrics`, `metric_types`, `milestones` | `metrics`, `milestones` | `dashboard-v2`, `growth-matrics`, `milestones` |
| Facilities | `facilities` | `facility_management` | `facilities-management`, `external-facilities-management` |
| In-app ads | `ads-management` | — (served as flag/config) | `ad-viewer` |
| IP / patents | `intellectual_property` (+ direct tenants-DB write) | `ip-management` (proxy) | `ip-search`, `ip-request` |

### 13. Two identically-named "scrapper" modules — unrelated
`sc-saas-admin/modules/scrapper/` (Capboard/IESA external scrapers + a `list.php` reading every tenant's DB) and `sanchiconnect-saas-tenants-admin/modules/scrapper.php` (a single file reading the tenants DB directly for platform reporting) share a name and nothing else — different repo, different purpose, different code. Treat as a naming collision, not a connection.

## Part D — Roles & access

Verified directly against code (role enums, guards, session role checks) on 2026-07-21 — not inferred from naming.

### D.0 — Who logs into which repo, at a glance

| Repo | Who accesses it | How |
|---|---|---|
| `sanchiconnect-saas-tenants` | Nobody, directly — no human login or UI. Consumed by `backend` at bootstrap and read/written directly by `tenants-admin` (shared DB). | N/A |
| `sc-saas-backend` | Nobody logs in directly — a JWT-authenticated API called by end-users (via `frontend`) and staff (via `admin`/`tenants-admin` cURL calls under their own separate sessions). A subset of privileged routes accept an `:adminMd5` path token instead of a JWT+role check, for admin-triggered writes. | JWT (`Role`/`accountType`) + `:adminMd5` token (admin-triggered routes) |
| `sc-saas-frontend` | End-users of 10 account types, self-registered. | JWT + localStorage session, `AuthGuard` per route |
| `sc-saas-admin` | Accelerator/incubator **internal staff** (7 roles, 2 dead) + a logically separate **external partner-org actor** (token-exchange login, not a staff role). | Session-based RBAC (`spa_admin_roles`, per-tenant) |
| `ai-startups-analyzer` | Nobody, directly — API-key authenticated, called only by `sc-saas-admin`. | Bcrypt-hashed API key |
| `sc-saas-3rdparty-webservices` | Nobody — no auth of any kind, relies entirely on network isolation. Called only by `sc-saas-backend` (+ one documented direct call from `admin`'s `meetings` module). | None (network-isolation only) |
| `sanchiconnect-saas-tenants-admin` | Sanchi's own **internal platform-operations staff** — same 7 role *names* as `sc-saas-admin` (this repo is a forked sibling codebase), but a logically separate role table scoped to the shared, platform-global tenants DB, not per-tenant. | Session-based RBAC (`spa_admin_roles`, platform-global) |

---

### D.1 — `sc-saas-frontend`: account types & portal access

**Account types** (`ACCOUNT_TYPE`, `src/app/core/domain/auth.model.ts`): `STARTUP, INVESTOR, OTHER, CORPORATE, PARTNER, JOB_SEEKER, MENTOR, SERVICE_PROVIDER, PROGRAM_OFFICE, INDIVIDUAL`. A separate `ACCOUNT_ROLE` enum (`FOUNDER`, `CO_FOUNDER`, `HIRING_MANAGER`, `BUSINESS_HEAD`) is a sub-role *within* an account (e.g. team-member permissions), not a portal-gating dimension.

**Mechanism:** `AuthGuard` (`shared/guards/auth.guard.ts`) compares the logged-in user's stored `accountType` against a route's `data.expectedType` array, redirecting via a per-type dashboard URL map when it doesn't match — a real redirect-based guard, but **only on routes where `expectedType` is actually declared.**

| Portal module | Restricted to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `startups` | `STARTUP` | Consistently enforced |
| `investors` | `INVESTOR` | Consistently enforced |
| `mentors` | `MENTOR` | Only one route enforces it; others have it commented out (stale copy-paste) but still require login |
| `service-provider` | `SERVICE_PROVIDER` | Enforced |
| `individual-profile` | `INDIVIDUAL` | Only the dashboard route enforces it |
| `partners-dashboard` | `PARTNER` | Enforced on the dashboard route |
| `corporate` | **Intended `CORPORATE` — mostly unenforced** | Only one edit route enforces it; dashboard + most edit pages have `expectedType` commented out — **any logged-in user of any account type can reach `/corporates/dashboard` by direct URL** |
| `program-office` | **Intended `PROGRAM_OFFICE` — not enforced anywhere** | No route in this module declares `expectedType` — **any logged-in user of any account type can reach the program-office dashboard/edit pages** |
| `account`, `team`, `chat`, `notifications`, `community-feed`, `dashboard-v2`, `payment`, `tickets`, `milestones` | none | Shared across all account types — login only |

**No admin account type exists in this app.** `admin-actions`' `/backdoor-login/:id/:uuid` is pure impersonation (no `AuthGuard`, no confirmation UI, md5-secret-protected) — real staff login only happens in the separate PHP admin panels.

---

### D.2 — `sc-saas-backend`: roles & route enforcement

**Role enum** (`Role`, `src/core/constants/enum.ts`): `STARTUP, INVESTOR, CORPORATE, MENTOR, INDIVIDUAL, SERVICE_PROVIDER, PARTNER, OTHER, JOB_SEEKER, PROGRAM_OFFICE` — the same 10 values as frontend's `ACCOUNT_TYPE`, carried in the JWT payload.

**Mechanism:** `@Roles(...)` decorator + `RolesGuard`, stacked alongside `JwtAuthGuard` and (independently) `FeatureGuard`+`@Features(...)`. `RolesGuard` checks `roles.includes(request.user.accountType)` — it only fires where a route pairs `@Roles(...)` with `@UseGuards(..., RolesGuard)`; where that pairing is broken, the decorator is dead metadata (see gaps below).

| Module(s) | Role(s) required |
|---|---|
| `startup` (+ founder, pitch-deck, supporting-docs, advisory-board, fundingCommitment), `power-pitch-module`, `learning-management`, `form-management` (partial) | STARTUP |
| `investor` | INVESTOR |
| `corporate` | CORPORATE |
| `mentors` | MENTOR |
| `mentorship` | STARTUP, MENTOR (mixed per route) |
| `service-providers` | SERVICE_PROVIDER |
| `individual` | INDIVIDUAL |
| `partner` | PARTNER (+ PROGRAM_OFFICE on one route) |
| `program-office-members` | PROGRAM_OFFICE |
| `vs-programs-management` | INDIVIDUAL |
| `job` | STARTUP/INVESTOR/CORPORATE/PARTNER/SERVICE_PROVIDER/PROGRAM_OFFICE (employer side); JOB_SEEKER + OTHER (seeker side) |
| `challenges` | CORPORATE (create/manage), STARTUP (participate) |
| `metrics`/`metrics-v2` | STARTUP/INVESTOR/CORPORATE/MENTOR/PARTNER (view), STARTUP-only (write) |
| `user` (team-members) | STARTUP/INVESTOR/CORPORATE/PARTNER/SERVICE_PROVIDER |
| All other modules (`auth`, `connections`, `notifications`, `events`, `memberships`, `payment-management`, `invoice`, `ip-management`, `facility_management`, etc.) | No role restriction — JWT-only (any authenticated account type) |

**Confirmed decorator-without-enforcement gaps:** `job.controller.ts`'s `GET applied/list` and `POST :jobUUID/apply` carry `@Roles(JOB_SEEKER)` but the guard chain omits `RolesGuard` — any authenticated user of any type can call them. `startup-kit.controller.ts`'s `check`/submission endpoints carry `@Roles(STARTUP)` with the same gap. `application-management`'s role check is fully commented out (`// @Roles(Role.STARTUP)`) — effectively JWT-only now.

**Admin/internal access — no role, md5-token pattern instead:** there is no `ADMIN` value in `Role`. Privileged routes triggered by the PHP admin panels bypass JWT+`@Roles` entirely via an `:adminMd5` path param checked against `AdminUsersEntity.authToken`. Confirmed on: `migrations` (all 6 routes, no JWT/Feature guard at all), `program-management` (`update-round`, `payment-reminder` — admin check commented out, i.e. unauthenticated, `reject-round`, `tentative-round`), `ecosystem-admin`, `facility_management`, `payment-management`, `challenges`, `learning-management`, `connections`, `mentors` (application-management), `memberships`, `application-management`, `events`, `global`/`admin-actions`, `vs-programs-management`.

---

### D.3 — `sc-saas-admin`: staff roles & module access

**Enforcement mechanism:** session-based RBAC. Login validates against `spa_admin_users`; the user's `spa_admin_roles` row (columns incl. `code`, `title`, `is_dev`, `features`, `tables`, `menus`) loads into `$_SESSION['admin_roles']` on every request via `getMenus()`. `checkRole($flag)` tests a boolean role attribute (most commonly `is_dev`); `checkAdminRole()`/inline comparisons test `$_SESSION['admin_roles']['code']` against role-ID constants `define()`d in `config/config.php` from per-tenant ENV values. `checkLoggedIn()` alone is **not** a role check — several modules use only that.

**Role constants** (`config/config.php`): `super_admin_role_id`, `developer_role_id` (paired with the `is_dev` flag), `program_manager_role_id`, `corporate_program_manager_role_id`, `jury_role_id`, `recruitmentpartner_role_id`, `tto_role_id`/`tto_superadmin_role_id`. `reviewer_role_id` and `analyst_role_id` are defined but **dead** — zero comparisons anywhere in code. `incubator_admin_role_id`/`incubator_program_manager_role_id` are synthetic roles auto-provisioned for external partner-org logins (see below), not internal staff.

| Restriction | Modules |
|---|---|
| `is_dev` only (super_admin + developer) | `developer/*` (api, database, email, forms, menu, table-view management), `reporting/*` (dashboards, template/source editors), `finance_management/settings/gateways/*` |
| Explicit `super_admin` OR `developer` code check | `developer/settings_management.php`, `developer/email_template_preview.php`, cost-visibility gates in `application_management` (`analysis_list.php`, `analysis_cost_dashboard.php`, `analysis_result.php`) |
| `jury_role_id` only | All of `jury/*` (dashboard, programs, round review, ratings, startups) |
| `program_manager_role_id` (+ `corporate_program_manager_role_id` for challenge flows) | `application_management/program.php`, `reports.php`, `submission-application-management*.php`, `edit_program_round*.php` |
| `recruitmentpartner_role_id` only | `recruitment-partners/jobs.php`, `job-detail.php` |
| Explicitly excludes jury, otherwise open to any staff | `application_management/analysis_list.php`, `edit_program_round.php`, `draft_applications.php`, `finance_management/{payments,coupons,orders}/list.php` |
| `checkLoggedIn()` only — no role check | `system_logs/*` (any staff role can view raw log payloads), `ai_credits/*`, `profile_audit_logs/list.php` |
| `tto_role_id` | `intellectual_property/*` |

**`partners` is a genuinely different actor, not a staff role:** `partners/auth/login.php` exchanges a frontend `accessToken` cookie via cURL against `v1/users/profile/`, sets `login_auth_type = "partner"` + `partner_id`/`partner_org_uuid`, and scopes all queries to that external organization. It auto-provisions a synthetic `spa_admin_roles` row (`incubator_admin`/`incubator_pm`) purely so existing `checkRole()` code paths still work — this is plumbing, not a real internal role. `recruitment-partners/`, despite the similar name, is an ordinary internal-staff module gated by `recruitmentpartner_role_id` through the regular admin session.

---

### D.4 — `sanchiconnect-saas-tenants-admin`: platform-operator roles & module access

Confirmed directly in `config/config.php:117-140`: the same 7 role-ID constants as `sc-saas-admin` (`super_admin_role_id`, `reviewer_role_id`, `recruitmentpartner_role_id`, `jury_role_id`, `developer_role_id`, `program_manager_role_id`, `analyst_role_id`) — all actively referenced here, unlike the two dead ones in the sibling repo. This is not a documentation copy-paste error: this repo is a forked sibling codebase of `sc-saas-admin`, so the role *names* carry over even though they read oddly for a platform-operator tool ("jury"/"recruitment_partner" are vestigial from the shared template). The `spa_admin_roles` table here lives in the **shared, platform-global tenants DB** — a logically separate role table from `sc-saas-admin`'s per-tenant one, despite identical mechanics. `sc-saas-admin` additionally defines `tto_role_id`, `tto_superadmin_role_id`, `corporate_program_manager_role_id`, which don't exist here.

**Mechanism:** the same `checkRole($flag)` (boolean attribute, e.g. `is_dev`) and inline `$_SESSION['admin_roles']['code'] == ...` comparisons as `sc-saas-admin`; role data refreshes post-login via `getMenus()` → `checkRoleUpdates()`.

| Module | Gate | Role(s) required |
|---|---|---|
| `developer/*` (api_management, table_view_management, menu_management, form_fields_management, forms_layout_management, email_management, database_management) | `is_dev` flag | Any role carrying `is_dev` (typically `developer`) |
| `developer/settings_management.php`, `email_templates.php` | code check | `super_admin` or `developer` |
| `developer/data_export.php` | `is_dev` OR `super_admin` code | `is_dev` flag, or `super_admin` |
| `ai_credits/*` (grants, task_rates, orders, packages, setup_menu) | code check | `super_admin` or `developer` |
| `finance_management/*` (invoices, taxes, invoice_settings, invoice_view, setup_menu) | code check | `super_admin` or `developer` |
| `auth/admins.php` | code check (page); `is_dev` (full role visibility) | `super_admin` or `developer` |
| `aws/s3.php`, `filemanager/list.php`, `upload/rich_editor.php` | `checkLoggedIn()` only | Any logged-in operator, any of the 7 roles |
| `aws/ajax.php`, `filemanager/ajax.php`/`download.php`, `csv/export.php`/`import.php` | none | Unauthenticated — see the `csv`/`filemanager`/`aws` findings in each repo's own module-specs index |

`add.php`/`edit.php` also do targeted `program_manager_role_id`/`jury_role_id` lookups for conditional form-section visibility — not an access gate, just what's shown.

---

### D.5 — No human role model (leaf / internal services)

- **`sanchiconnect-saas-tenants`** — no UI, no login. Every route is either called by `backend` at bootstrap or read/written directly by `tenants-admin` against the shared DB; the confirmed-unauthenticated `verify_tenant`/`tenant-settings` routes (Part B, repo 1) have no role concept at all, just no auth.
- **`sc-saas-3rdparty-webservices`** — no auth of any kind on any endpoint; security is "only `sc-saas-backend` can reach this network path," not a role check.
- **`ai-startups-analyzer`** — bcrypt-hashed API keys (`api_keys` table), checked per-request; no concept of roles, just "has a valid key or not." Called only by `sc-saas-admin`, which itself decides which of its own staff roles are allowed to trigger a score run (see D.3, `application_management`).
