# SAN-976 — always tell the admin the month was rejected before

Companion to SAN-975 (backend now returns only the **same month's** previous rejected claim).

## Problem

Admin `/operation_cost/claims` → View Details. When a startup re-applied for a month that had been rejected, the admin often saw no sign of the earlier rejection. Reported case: Vami Dummy, Month 9, TR26-ELMA2-000015, on dev.

## Classification

CODE_ERROR.

## Root cause

`populatePreviousSubmissionView()` in `themes/default/html/operation_cost/claims.php` returned early when `previousRejectedClaim.bankDetails` was null, which hid the whole "Previous Submission" tab. `bankDetails` is null for any rejected claim without a Beneficiary Details snapshot: rows created by **Migrate Offline Claim**, and claims submitted before SAN-904.

## Fix (sc-saas-admin, `themes/default/html/operation_cost/claims.php`)

- The tab now shows whenever `previousRejectedClaim` exists. When there's no snapshot, Beneficiary Details reads "not recorded for this claim", and the diff card stays hidden because there's nothing to compare. With a snapshot, behavior is unchanged.
- New red notice at the top of the **Current Submission** view: "Month N was previously rejected on <date> — "<reason>". See the Previous Submission tab for details." This way the admin sees it without opening the tab. It's cleared in `resetDetailsModal()`.

## Verification

- No `php` binary locally, so `php -l` couldn't run. The page's inline JS was extracted (PHP tags stubbed out) and passes `node --check`.
- sc-saas-admin has no test framework.
- Manual check in the browser not done yet. It needs the SAN-975 backend deployed too.

## Commit

Pending (not committed).
