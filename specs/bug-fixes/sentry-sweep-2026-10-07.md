# Sentry sweep — 2026-10-07 (69 unresolved groups triaged; SAN-1753 … SAN-1758 filed)

- **Linear:** Production Defects (P-SAN-46), milestone M5 · **Assignee:** Aman kabra · **Org:** Sentry `sanchisaas`
- **Policy applied (user, 2026-10-07):** fix in code ⇒ Linear Done + Sentry resolved, deployment state not required; recurrence on a build containing the fix ⇒ reopen and look at the other side (infra / other call site). Noise with nothing to fix ⇒ resolved with reason.
- **Process:** 10-step loop. Step 6 (tests first) blocked workspace-wide (no `guardian` skill) — substituted `tsc --noEmit` (frontend, backend), `php -l` + a fake-PDO simulation (tenants-admin). **No automated test coverage was added.** Nothing was run against a real DB, a browser or a deployed build.

## New tickets filed
| Ticket | Sentry | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| SAN-1753 | TENANTS-2 (`PATCH /ecosystem/startups` → GlobalExceptionFilter, 1,145 ev) | **Done — already fixed in code**: `1ef4df9` (SAN-1014, 2026-10-05) validates `x-client-domain` synchronously (400) and drops `validateCustomDecorators`. Events came from a container started 2026-10-04 (pre-fix). Inferred from `app_start_time`; no release tag. |
| SAN-1754 | BACKEND-3M (`Unknown column 'NaN'`, 188 ev) | **Done — hardening, root cause not proven.** `d254dc94` (0/0 guard + `failed_table`/`failedQuery` diagnostics) plus 9 more unguarded `Math.ceil((100*completed)/total)` sites guarded (corporate, individual, mentor, partner, service-provider, startup repos; investor ×2; program-office-member) and `calculateQuantitativeMilestonePercent` (`targetValue > 0`). Reopen if it recurs and read `failed_table`. |
| SAN-1755 | ADMIN-11 / -12 (undefined functions) | **Done — no change.** Both events `environment=local` (dev machine); `zenxaiConfig()` removed by SAN-1739 (`77437530`), `juryVisibilityRoundColumns()` is defined in `includes/jury_visibility_functions.php` and loaded by `index.php:40`. |
| SAN-1756 | FRONTEND-GJ (`countInvalidFields` → `controls` of undefined) | **Done.** `financials-details.component.ts` getter returns 0 until `financeForm` exists (template binds it before `createForm()`). |
| SAN-1757 | TENANTS-ADMIN-4 / -A / -8 (1040, 2006) | **Done.** `config/config.php` bootstrap retry on 1040 (same as SAN-1736) + `core/db.php` reconnect-once for plain SELECTs on 2006/2013. Fake-PDO simulation: 2006/2013 once ⇒ retried; twice ⇒ thrown after 1 reconnect; 1146 / INSERT / UPDATE / FOR UPDATE ⇒ thrown, no reconnect. Writes/transactions on a dead connection are NOT retried. |
| SAN-1758 | FRONTEND-7T / -GM / -ET | **Left OPEN — product decision.** See below. -7T/-ET resolved as noise. |

## Existing tickets re-checked
- **SAN-1672 / SAN-557 (FRONTEND-26, 3,840 ev / 1,747 users)**: retry `e233de1af` is in code; events are on older releases. Resolved. If it recurs on a build with `e233de1af`, the cause is the shared tenants API (timeouts/CORS/capacity), not the frontend.
- **SAN-1663 (BACKEND-4X)**: `21a495f5` in code; running task predates it. Resolved.
- **SAN-1736 (ADMIN-5)**: `c9de651c` in code. **Sentry group resolved under the new policy** — note the SAN-1736 record had deliberately left it open until capacity is addressed; the underlying cause (shared MySQL `max_connections`, SAN-140) is still an infra decision.
- **SAN-454 (BACKEND-9, S3 SignatureDoesNotMatch)**: speculative fix — `attachmentDisposition()` in `amazon-s3.service.ts` keeps the signed `ContentDisposition` header pure ASCII (ASCII fallback + RFC 5987 `filename*=`); ASCII names produce a byte-identical header. Earlier investigations (SAN-406) called this an env/region/credentials problem; if it recurs, that is the cause.
- **SAN-1024 (G5)**: fix `5732ec2db` (2026-09-28) was already in code — an earlier reopen of this ticket in this sweep was **wrong** (searched `git log --grep` by ticket ID, which that commit doesn't cite) and was retracted.
- **SAN-924 (4C)**: `3cf4994d8` (SAN-567) in code; retracted reopen. The trise 504 is infra.
- **SAN-920 (EP, ngx-ui-loader master duplicated)**: event is from release `022eafd6` (2026-07-31). Fixed a proven collision on `/hire`: `dashboard-common-calender` gets `@Input() renderLoader = true` (`*ngIf`), `hire.component.html` passes `[renderLoader]="false"`. ~95 other bare `<ngx-ui-loader>` remain — a collision needs two mounted at once and is not provable from source; bulk renaming would break modals that rely on the master loader. SAN-433 (CI guard / auto-id wrapper) was never implemented.
- **FRONTEND-2W (504 on `profile/data/<type>/<uuid>`)**: all 8 callers of `fetchDynamicFormData` lacked an error handler; each now has a no-op one (service already toasts). The supernova 504 itself is infra.
- **G9, 7W**: fixes already in code (SAN-213 `18eb14037`, SAN-576 `3791f938b`); old builds. **2F, AH**: small frontend fixes (localStorage try/catch in `program-public-apply`; removed `showLoaderOnConfirm` without `preConfirm` in `growth-matrics`).
- Resolved as noise/no-fix: FRONTEND-1 (local env), EX, F2, 7T, ET, 6E (= BACKEND-9).

## SAN-1758 — open, needs product owner / dev lead
Frontend `PitchDocumentTypes` = `fundraising-pitch | sales-pitch | hiring-pitch`; backend = `fundraising-pitch | pitch-document`. Backend removed sales/hiring **on purpose** (`d4fd191b`, May 2023: enum values, every `sales_*`/`hiring_*` column of `StartupPitchDeckEntity`, repository methods). Adding the enum values would only swap a 400 for another and let a sales delete wipe the fundraising document (route ignores type), a sales video overwrite the fundraising video, and `savePitchDocument`'s switch (fundraising only) 200 with `undefined`. **Tried and reverted** — no backend change left. Decision: (A) rebuild sales/hiring in the backend (columns + repository + switch + per-tenant migration) or (B) remove them from the frontend UI (recommended). Also observed: frontend calls routes the backend doesn't serve (`PATCH startup/pitch-deck/power-pitch` commented out; pitch-deck `supporting-documents` routes; `compile/...`).

## Still open (deliberately)
SAN-455 (BACKEND-X) and SAN-1152 (BACKEND-4F): only diagnostics in code (`fe33f96e` axios tags; `d254dc94` `failed_table`) — need a post-deploy event naming the call site/table. TENANTS-5 / -6: shared MySQL `max_connections` / refused connections (infra: `max_connections`, RDS Proxy). ~30 minor groups untouched (perf flags, handled "not found" faults, dev-tenant SES/SMTP config, stale singles).

## Contract impact
None. No controller/DTO/flag/auth change; tenant scoping untouched. (An additive backend enum change was explored for SAN-1758 and reverted.)

## Commits
sc-saas-backend, sc-saas-frontend, sanchiconnect-saas-tenants-admin, sc-saas-admin (spec line), and this record in the workspace repo — all on `ai_native_setup_aman` / `ai_native_setup` per repo convention. Not deployed.

## Part 2 — follow-up sweep (same day, 73 groups shown after the first pass)
Sentry showed 73 unresolved because (a) a 90-day view surfaced groups last seen up to 3 months ago that the 30-day view hid, (b) FRONTEND-26 regressed (events keep arriving, resolved groups with no release tag reopen on any new event) and (c) one new group appeared (GV).

- **FRONTEND-26 — real root cause is the tenants API, not the frontend (verified live):** `sanchiconnect-saas-tenants/src/main.ts` rejects any origin not in `CORS_DOMAINS` or the DB-backed `cors_domains` registry (SAN-384, intentional) with **HTTP 418 and no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`**; a browser reports that as status 0 "Unknown Error". Probe: `connect.trise.tripura.gov.in`, `app.sanchiconnect.com`, `demo.sanchiapp.com` => 200 + ACAO; **`sg.sanchiapp.com`, `messenger.sanchiapp.com`, `thub.sanchidev.in` => 418**. Fix is ops/data (register real tenant origins via tenants-admin CORS Domain Management; ~30 s cache, no deploy) or filtering non-tenant hosts out of Sentry. No production data was changed. Group left OPEN (it will keep regressing until then). Posted on SAN-557.
- **FRONTEND-GV (new, local env):** `membership-plans` emits `null` when the payment-verify API errors; `handleVerifyPayment` then read `response.length` on null. Early-return guard added in `application-program-management-dynamic-form` and `programs-details-page` (same unguarded read). Resolved.
- **FRONTEND-8H:** `profile-viewers.openDetailsView` split a null `viewerCompanyName`; now `(name || '')` and the slug segment is only added when non-empty. Resolved.
- **Resolved with no code change (reasons recorded on each Sentry group):** perf flags (D0, DK, 39); unsymbolicated `<unknown>` (63, DJ, 8J, 8V, 8N, 5F, DW — SAN-221/446); old NG0100 dev-mode class (B2, 6M, 1J, 1C, 1H, 1D, 25, 24, DY); handled business-rule faults and single dev-tenant events (7B, GK, FE, FC, 83, 7Y, EQ, EN, EA, FF, FD, DS, 6B, D7, AA, G0, GH, G7, DP, BF, BE); library-internal (C1 ng-select, 9S loom sdk, DF/DE ng-bootstrap datepicker, 4D bootstrap data-api); stale infra (BACKEND-1H, ADMIN-F, TENANTS-ADMIN-5/6/9, A0, AI-ANALYZER-6, 3RDPARTY-3/4, GB old-browser); 8R/GS/FS/GP unlocatable single events. ADMIN-X/FX/FZ are dev-tenant config.
- **Still open on purpose:** FRONTEND-26 (ops: CORS registry), FRONTEND-GM / SAN-1758 (product decision), BACKEND-X / SAN-455 and BACKEND-4F / SAN-1152 (need a post-deploy event), TENANTS-5/-6 (shared MySQL capacity), FRONTEND-4B / SAN-1144 (In Review).
- **Caveat:** "resolved with no change" rows are judgments from event data, not fixes; each Sentry comment says to reopen on recurrence, per the standing policy.

## Part 3 — final closure (user delegated: "check in code; change only if required, otherwise close")
- **Tenants code reviewed — no change required.** `resolve-domain` already has a 30 s cache + in-flight coalescing (`f74d37d`, SAN-557, 2026-10-05, on `ai_native_setup`); the registry gate (`CorsDomainsService.isRegisteredHostname` + `main.ts` origin callback, SAN-384) is intentional. The leading-wildcard `LIKE` match in `matchesTenant` is the frozen `verify_tenant` match (contract tripwire #1) and is now behind the cache — not changed. FRONTEND-26 (3,854 ev), TENANTS-5, TENANTS-6 resolved with those commits cited; remaining status-0 volume is an ops/data item (unregistered origins, list on SAN-557: `sg.sanchiapp.com` ≈ half the events; `acceleration.ihubgujarat.in`, `edge.isba.in` look like real customers; raw-IP hosts are bots) plus transient client network drops. **No domain was registered by me** (production data).
- **FRONTEND-GM / SAN-1758 — Canceled (not fixed).** Sales/hiring pitch is only in the frontend (routes, profile pages, carousels, module spec); the backend removed it deliberately (`d4fd191b`, 2023). 2 events / 1 user. Removing or rebuilding it is a product decision; an additive backend enum change was tried and reverted. Recorded on the ticket.
- **FRONTEND-4B / SAN-1144, BACKEND-X / SAN-455, BACKEND-4F / SAN-1152 — closed with no actionable cause in code.** Diagnostics are in place (`fe33f96e` axios tags + SAN-988 cron wrapper; `d254dc94` `failed_table`), so a recurrence will name the source. These are **closed, not fixed.**
- **Sentry unresolved count after this pass: see below** (any group that fires again will reopen automatically; per policy, treat a recurrence on a fixed build as the other side's problem).

## Part 4 — last group (FRONTEND-14 / SAN-1759) — real fix, not noise
Listed as "library noise" in the project description, but the event proved a real, still-live defect on a release that already had SAN-151's fix: `formatMeetingData()` (`modules/calender/helpers.ts`) overwrites `timeFrom/timeTo` with `'hh:mm a'`, so a second pass re-parsed `"2026-10-22 11:00 am"` with no format (`_f: undefined`) and moment fell back to native `Date()`. Fix: explicit format list `['YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss','YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm','YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm a']` for the from/to parses. Verified with a node script on the repo's `moment-timezone` (9 cases, 0 warnings; the old parse reproduces the warning) + `tsc`; no browser run, no Karma (SAN-1653). Committed to `ai_native_setup_aman`. **Sentry unresolved: 0 after this resolve** (any new event reopens its group).

Gap Register: not opened — `/bug-fix` work is exempt from the Gap Register ceremony (CLAUDE.md step 9). The one real gap worth tracking is SAN-433 (systemic ngx-ui-loader fix: CI guard / auto-id wrapper — ~95 bare loaders remain) and the SAN-1758 product decision.

## Part 5 — new groups that appeared while closing out (all `environment: local`)
- **BACKEND-52/53/54/55/56** (`reading 'id'` of undefined in `ConnectionsService.getConnectionsListBasic` / `getConnections` / `getConnectionsRequestByType`, `MeetingsService.getPendingAcceptanceMeetingsList`, `DashboardService.getDashboardUser`) and **FRONTEND-Y** (500 on `GET /connections`, 19 events) and **FRONTEND-74** (403 on `jobs/interviews/job-applicant`, 61 events): every event is `environment=local` — a developer's Docker container (Alpine, node 16, app start 2026-10-07T04:47Z) and dev machine against the dev tenant. **0 production events** in 30 days (21 backend events, all local). Resolved with that evidence; reopen only if one appears with `environment=production`.
- **Latent gap, not changed (no production evidence, needs a per-site decision):** `userRepository.getParentUserByProfileType(...)` returns `undefined` for a profile with no parent user row, and about a dozen call sites in `connections.service.ts` (lines ~1378, 1592, 1759, 1822, 1969, 2036, 2232, 3064, ...), `dashboard.service.ts:54` and `corporate.service.ts:402` dereference `.id` without a check. The right fallback differs per call (empty list vs 404 vs treat the user as their own parent), so it was not guessed. Worth a ticket if an orphaned profile can occur in production data.
- **Left OPEN on purpose: FRONTEND-26.** It was resolved earlier and reopened within minutes because real production users on unregistered hosts keep hitting it (`sg.sanchiapp.com` ≈ half of 3,858 events / ~1,750 users get a 418 with no CORS header). Resolving it again would only hide an unfixed outage for those users; the fix is the ops action in SAN-557 (register the origins in tenants-admin). Filter-out of bot IPs is the other half.
- Process note: the sweep's first passes did not filter by environment. Next time start with `environment:production` and treat `environment:local` groups as dev noise.
