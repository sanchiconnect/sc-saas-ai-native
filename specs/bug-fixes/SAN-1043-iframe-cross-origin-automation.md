# SAN-1043: "Unable to access iframe" SecurityError on program apply

## Classification
ENV_ERROR (external automation script), no code change

## Root cause
The stack is `buildDomTree (eval at evaluate) ... UtilityScript.evaluate`, which is a browser-automation / AI-agent DOM walker (Playwright UtilityScript, browser-use-style `buildDomTree.js`) injected into the page. The string doesn't exist anywhere in sc-saas-frontend or its node_modules. Our console hook just forwarded its `console.warn`.

## Fix
No code change. Recommend ignoring this issue in Sentry.

## Files changed
- none

## Verification
`npx tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit` is clean, and `ng build --configuration development` (AOT, covers the templates) exited 0. No automated regression test has been added yet; one is proposed and waiting for approval. Contract check: frontend-only, and no controller/DTO/flag was touched, so /audit-contract, /trace-flag and /check-isolation don't apply.

## Existing-flow check (no functionality broken)
No code change.

## 10-step process (SanchiConnect Developer Guide)
1. **Orient:** read the Sentry issue, event details and breadcrumbs. Done.
2. **/from-linear:** the Linear issue was created from Sentry and filed in the *Production Defects* project, assigned to Mahima. Done.
3. **Spec:** narrowly scoped, single-repo fix, so the lightweight `/bug-fix` path was used (this record) instead of a feature spec. Done.
4. **Design questions:** none pending. Data/ops follow-ups (if any) are listed above and not invented here.
5. **Contract check:** frontend-only. No controller, DTO, flag or tenant-scoped query changed, so `/audit-contract`, `/trace-flag` and `/check-isolation` don't apply. Backend code was only read, never edited.
6. **Tests first:** blocked workspace-wide (no guardian skill). As a substitute, `npx tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit` is clean and the `ng build --configuration development` AOT build exited 0. No automated regression test has been added; one is proposed and waiting for Mahima's go-ahead.
7. **Branch:** the working tree is `sc-saas-frontend` on `ai_native_setup_mahima`. No new branch was created. (CLAUDE.md names `ai_native_setup`; Mahima decides.)
8. **Implement:** done, see Fix.
9. **Verify:** existing-flow check above, bug-fix record written, Linear moved to In Review with a root-cause comment.
10. **Commit/push:** **not done, on purpose.** Waiting for Mahima's manual verification. Linear moves to Done only after that.
