# FA-011 — Limit Jury Access

## Source & evidence status

- **Requirements source:** *BRD — Limit Jury Access v0.3*, 5 Oct 2026, business owner Dr. Sunil Shekhawat (16 pp incl. wireframes W1–W6; decisions D1–D5 resolved). Supplied in chat 2026-10-06. BRD ids (FR-, BR-, NFR-, US-, D1–D5, W1–W6) are cited as written.
- **Code evidence:** three read-only sweeps of `sc-saas-admin` + `sc-saas-backend` on 2026-10-06 (form data model, juror data surfaces, round settings/Kanban/rubric), key claims spot-checked by hand. Paths below are relative to each repo root. `ADMIN` = `sc-saas-admin`, `BE` = `sc-saas-backend/src`.
- **Tag legend** (specs/spec-authoring-practices.md Practice 3): unmarked + `file:line` = evidenced; `[INFERRED — requires validation]`; `[DESIGN DECISION PENDING]`; `[DECIDED — recommended default]` = taken on a recommended default, owner may override.

## Roles — no new role is introduced

"Juror" in this spec (and in the BRD) means **an existing admin user who has the existing jury role** (`spa_admin_roles.code = jury_role_id`, `config/config.php:225-252`), logging into the existing jury portal (`modules/jury/*`). This feature adds **no new role, no new role permission column and no new user type**. Every BRD role maps to something that already exists:

| BRD role | Existing role in code | What this feature does for it |
|---|---|---|
| Jury / Evaluator | jury role (`jury_role_id`) | sees the restricted application view |
| Jury reviewer (not named in BRD) | the **same jury role**, with the existing per-user flag `spa_admin_users.is_jury_reviewer = 1` (`checkIfJuryisReviewer()`, `core_functions.php:4714-4728`) — not a separate role | sees the same restricted view (D-Reviewers) |
| Program Manager | `program_manager_role_id` / `corporate_program_manager_role_id`, listed in the programme's `program_managers` | configures Limit Access |
| Program Admin | any other existing non-jury admin role passing the existing programme scope check (`juryNdaManageScope()`) | configures Limit Access, exports activity |
| Partner (incubator admin) | existing partner login, own `partner_id` only | configures Limit Access on own programmes |
| Super Admin | `super_admin_role_id` | full access |

The only role checks used are: "is this session the jury role?" (restrict / deny) and the existing scope helper (who may configure). Nothing is added to `spa_admin_roles`, `spa_admin_users` or `config.php` roles.

## Problem

Every question on a programme's application form (and every round form) is shown to every allotted juror. Sensitive answers — financials, cap table, KYC (PAN/Aadhaar), bank details, named customers — reach external evaluators. The BRD asks for a per-round, server-enforced "hidden from jury" set of questions, configured from Round Settings → Jury Allotment, audited, and editable until evaluation closes (BRD §2, §5).

### What the code actually looks like (drives the design)

1. **The juror experience is PHP admin, not the SPA/backend.** Jurors are `spa_admin_users` with the jury role and use `ADMIN/modules/jury/*`; there are **no juror-facing backend endpoints** (only `:adminMd5` email routes, `BE/modules/admin-actions/admin-actions.controller.ts:961,985,1012`). Same finding as FA-010. → The BRD's `GET/PUT /rounds/{id}/visibility` API (§12) is implemented as admin Medoo handlers, not backend routes.
2. **Questions are JSON, keyed by a stable random key.** `forms.fields` is an array of sections `{key:"section_XXXXXXXXXX", name, type:"form_section", multi_value, visiblity, fields:[<JSON-string of field>]}`; each field has `key:"field_"+10 random chars` (`ADMIN/themes/default/html/form-management/edit-form.php:2779-2786,3214,3345`). Keys are **reused on every edit/re-order** and only generated when missing (`:3360-3362`). → `(form_id, field_key)` is a usable stable question id (BRD Assumption 1 holds, with caveats in Edge cases).
3. **A juror sees more than one form.** `round-applications.php:800-811` loads the submission's main form **plus every active round form of the programme** (not only the current round's). Round forms are separate `forms` rows (`application_program_rounds.form_id`, `BE/modules/application-management/entities/application-program-rounds.entity.ts:137-138`; created by `createRoundForm`, `ADMIN/modules/application_management/edit_program_round.php:1585-1620`). Round-form answers are separate `forms_submissions` rows looked up by `(form_id, email)` (`round-applications.php:825-828`).
4. **Answers** are `forms_submissions.data` JSON keyed by `field_key`; multi-value sections store `section_key → [ {field_key: value} ]`. Uploaded files are S3 keys **inside** the answer (no file table) (`form-field.component.ts:417-428`, upload key `BE/core/upload-module/upload.service.ts:70-89`).
5. **URLs are minted for every answer before the template runs.** `formatFormSubmissionsData()` (`ADMIN/includes/custom_form_functions.php:397`) creates a **7-day** presigned URL for each `file_upload` (`formatFileFields` :41-75 → `generateS3SignedUrl`, `core_functions.php:3381-3391`) and a **public, non-expiring ImageKit URL** for each `image_upload`/`video_upload` (`formatImageFields` :317, `formatVideoFields` :340 → `generateS3FileUrl` :3367). → The filter **must run before** `formatFormSubmissionsData` (`round-applications.php:839`), not in the template.
6. **Conditional logic exists, one level.** Fields and sections carry `visiblity:{show, field:<parent key>, condition:"is"|"is_not", value}` (`edit-form.php` template :1700-1730, :1915-1945). The juror template evaluates these against other answers (`themes/default/html/jury/round-applications.php:355-384, 432-433`). Child→parent only; no reverse index.
7. **There is no rubric-criterion ↔ question link.** `application_program_submission_rating_criterias` = id, name, description, weightage, is_active, program_id, program_round_id (`BE/.../application-program-submission-ratings-types.entity.ts:3-25`); jury questions (`application-programs-jury-questions.entity.ts:8-45`) likewise have no form/field reference. → BR-03 / US-04 warning has nothing to evaluate (see D-Rubric).
8. **There is no round-level "evaluation closed" state.** `application_program_rounds` has no end date / closed flag / status beyond soft-delete `status`/`deleted_at` (full column list: entity :14-177). Nearest: round `freeze_applications` (blocks moving/rejecting), `editable_jury_ratings`, and programme-level `program_closed` (`application-programs.entity.ts:79-94`, makes the Kanban read-only, theme `submission-application-management.php:1652-1656`). → BR-08 resolved by D-Closed.
9. **Jurors can reach full application data outside the jury module today.** `ADMIN/modules/application-submission-detail.php:2` only calls `checkLoggedIn()` (verified) — it exposes `download_pdf :288`, `get_attachment_urls :894`, `download_attachments :937`, AI `download_screening :1123` / `download_prior_art :1129`, transcripts `:30,:102`, all via `collectSubmissionExportData()` (`includes/submission_export_helpers.php:10-160`) which exports **every** field. `application_management/form-submission-detail.php:2` and `submission-application-management.php` exports (`download_program_data(_xlsx) :1628`, `download_bulk_pdf :2179`) have no jury block either; `analysis_form.php` (`generateThesisDraft` → analyzer `:137`) only `checkLoggedIn()`. Already recorded as F1 in FA-010's `nda-gate-repro-matrix.md:78-83`. `[INFERRED — requires validation]` that a jury session actually gets HTTP 200 (code has no block; not run). → Filtering only the jury page would leave FR-09/FR-10 unmet. See D-Block / OQ-4.
10. **Existing precedent to copy:** programme documents already have a per-round `is_jury_can_view` filter in the jury view (`round-applications.php:1038,1046`; set in `edit_program_round.php:1823`). FA-010 provides a fail-closed scope check `juryNdaManageScope()` (`includes/jury_nda_functions.php:935-1000`), an audit wrapper `juryNdaAudit()` (:2729-2752) and a schema probe `juryNdaSchemaReady()` (used `edit_program_round.php:2687`).

## Decisions taken on recommended defaults

| # | Decision | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| D-Store | Hidden set stored as rows `(round_id, form_id, field_key)` in a new table; section-level selection in the UI just selects all its field keys (sections are not stored). | stable keys (finding 2); one row per hidden question gives clean audit diffs and indexes |
| D-List | The pop-up lists **every form the juror sees for that round**: the programme's main form, then each active round form (in round `id` order), each grouped by its sections — i.e. exactly the set loaded at `round-applications.php:800-811`. Fields of type with `invisible:"1"` are still listed. | FR-02 "every question"; finding 3. Listing only the main form would leave round-form answers unhideable. |
| D-Scope | One hidden set per **application-management round** (`application_program_rounds`). Legacy `program_rounds`, mentor, individuals and venture-studio jury pages (`round-startups.php`, `round-individuals.php`, `round-mentors.php`, `startups.php`) are out of scope. | Same scoping as FA-010 D-Scope; BRD is about the CFA Kanban |
| D-Which | A juror opening an application in round R gets round R's hidden set applied to **all** forms rendered (main + all round forms). | BRD "round-level configuration" (§5) |
| D-Child | BR-05 is computed **at read time**: any field or section whose `visiblity.field` is a hidden key (transitively) is also hidden. Children are not auto-ticked in the pop-up; the pop-up shows them as "also hidden (depends on Qn)". | no reverse index exists (finding 6); read-time closure stays correct after form edits |
| D-Section | A section whose every visible field is hidden is dropped, heading included (W5 note 2). Multi-value sections: hidden sub-field keys are removed from every row. | W5; finding 4 |
| D-Rubric | **BR-03 / US-04 warning and the "Used in scoring" tag are deferred** — no rubric↔question link exists (finding 7). BRD Assumption 3 explicitly allows this ("if not, the warning is deferred"). BR-02 (cannot hide everything) **is** in scope. | BRD §14 Assumption 3 |
| D-NoAPI | No backend endpoint. Config load/save, copy-from-round, activity log and preview are admin POST handlers on `edit_program_round.php` (`submitAction=jury_visibility_*`), like every other round setting. Backend only owns the schema. | finding 1; FA-010 precedent |
| D-Prev | "Copy from previous round" (FR-13) = the same programme's round with the greatest `id` lower than the current one, `status=1`, `deleted_at IS NULL`. Only keys whose form/field still exists are copied. | `priority` exists but is never written (`submission-application-management.php:298-306`); effective order is `id` |
| D-Unreviewed | "N new questions not reviewed" (W1 state 3): on save store a snapshot of all listed field keys on the round; unreviewed = current keys − snapshot, shown only when the hidden set is non-empty. Opening and saving the pop-up refreshes the snapshot. | BRD §9 edge case |
| D-Audit | `spa_admin_logs` via a wrapper `juryVisibilityAudit()` modelled on `juryNdaAudit()`; `module='jury_visibility'`, actions `visibility_saved`, `visibility_copied`, `visibility_activity_exported`; `data` = `{round_id, hidden_added:[{form_id,field_key,label}], hidden_removed:[…], hidden_total, ip, remote_addr, user_agent}`. `createAdminLogs` stores no IP itself (`core_functions.php:6517-6543`) so IP goes in `data`. Application-level immutability only (same as FA-010 D-Immut). | NFR-04; FA-010 D-Immut |
| D-Perm | Config & activity endpoints: `checkLoggedIn()` + not jury role + `verifyCSRFToken()` + `juryNdaManageScope()` (partner on own `partner_id`, PM only if in `program_managers`, corporate PM by `corporate_id`, jury denied). Activity **export** (NFR-04): Super Admin, or a programme-scoped admin passing the same scope check. No new role and no new role permission column — existing roles only (see "Roles"). | BR-01, NFR-03; reuse of shipped fail-closed helper |
| D-Fail | NFR-07: if the hidden-set query returns `false` (Medoo error) on a round whose table exists → jury page shows an error, **no answers rendered**. If the table does not exist yet (admin deployed before backend) → feature treated as unavailable: config button hidden, jury view unchanged (nothing can be hidden). | NFR-07; FA-010 D-Gate pattern |
| D-TTL | In jury context only, `file_upload` presigned URLs drop from 7 days to **15 minutes**. Image/video public ImageKit URLs are **not** changed in R1 (residual, see Risks). | NFR-02 hardening; changing ImageKit delivery is a larger change |
| D-Pitch | Pitch deck (`forms_submissions.pitch_document`) and Power Pitch video (`power_pitch_url`, per form) are **not form questions**. They are added to the pop-up as two fixed "system" rows in a top "Attachments" group, stored with `form_id = 0` and `field_key = '__pitch_deck'` / `'__power_pitch_video'`. Programme documents keep their existing per-round `is_jury_can_view` control (not duplicated). | W3 shows "Pitch deck" as a hideable row; finding 10 |
| D-Toast/Copy | UI copy as BRD §10 / W2–W6, adapted to the Bootstrap 4 + jQuery theme (not pixel-matched), same as FA-010 D-UI. | |
| D-Export/AI | **No juror export, print view or AI summary exists in the jury module today** (verified by grep). FR-10/FR-08 are therefore met for jury pages by construction, **provided** the jury role is blocked from the non-jury pages in finding 9 (D-Block). Any future juror export/AI must call `juryApplyHiddenFields()`; stated in the module spec. | finding 9 |
| D-Flag | Tenant flag `limit_jury_access_enabled` (default off) gates the **config UI** (button, pop-up, badges, activity, handlers). The **juror-side filter applies whenever hidden rows exist, regardless of the flag** — switching the flag off must never re-expose questions that were hidden. `[CONFIRMED — Nirmal, 2026-10-06, OQ-1]` | BRD §15 |
| D-Closed | BR-08 "evaluation closed" = programme `program_closed = 1` (`application-programs.entity.ts:79-94`). No new round-level close concept in R1. `[CONFIRMED — Nirmal, 2026-10-06, OQ-2]` | already makes the Kanban read-only |
| D-Reviewers | Jury users flagged as reviewers (existing `is_jury_reviewer = 1`, same jury role — not a separate role) get the **same restricted view** as other jury users, incl. the `previewOnly` iframe. (Differs from FA-010, which exempted reviewers from the NDA.) `[CONFIRMED — Nirmal, 2026-10-06, OQ-3]` | they are jury-role users |
| D-Block | Close the finding-9 leak by **blocking the jury role** (incl. reviewers) on `application-submission-detail.php`, `application_management/form-submission-detail.php`, `submission-application-management(.tableview).php` and `analysis_form.php` (redirect GET, 403 JSON on POST), rather than filtering their exports. Admin/PM exports stay complete (BRD §9 "Bulk export by admin: unaffected"). Ships **first, as its own Urgent issue**, independent of the flag. `[CONFIRMED — Nirmal, 2026-10-06, OQ-4]` | jurors have no legitimate use of these pages |

## Prior art (reused vs new)

| Need | Existing | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| Round record | `application_program_rounds` (entity :14-177) | **EXTEND**: 3 columns |
| Hidden-question store | none; precedent `application_program_report_charts.field_key` (`application-program_report_charts.entity.ts:11`) references form fields by key | **NEW** table |
| Jury answer rendering | `round-applications.php:799-849` → template :337-448 | **EXTEND**: filter before :839 |
| Per-round jury visibility of documents | `is_jury_can_view` (`round-applications.php:1038,1046`) | keep; model for the new filter |
| Scope / CSRF / audit / schema probe | FA-010 helpers in `includes/jury_nda_functions.php` | **REUSE** |
| Modal with checkbox list | `#juryNdaReminderModal` (theme `edit_program_round.php:767`), tri-state select-all `analysis_result.php:1111-1215`, `#manageChartsModal` keyed by `data-field-key` (`reports.php:521-560`) | **REUSE patterns** |
| Kanban round header | `fetchProgramData()` (`includes/application_program_management_funcs.php:23-117`) → `build_titles()` (`themes/default/assets/libs/kanban/js/kanban-applications.js:42-109`, header at :106) | **EXTEND**: `jury_hidden_count`, `jury_unreviewed_count` |
| Tableview round tabs | `submission-application-management-tableview.php` theme :484-491 | **EXTEND**: badge |
| Form parsing | `getFormDetails()` (`custom_form_functions.php:550-672`) | **REUSE** for pop-up list and filter |

## Acceptance criteria

**Configuration (Round Settings → Jury allotment) — W2, W3, W4**
- [ ] AC-1 (FR-01, BR-01, W2) "Limit Access" button with lock icon in the "Jury members for this round" card header; label "Limit Access (N hidden)" when N>0. Not rendered for jury sessions; config handlers return 403 JSON to jury / out-of-scope users (NFR-03).
- [ ] AC-2 (FR-07, W2) Helper line "Hidden questions apply to all N jurors in this round, including jurors added later." under the button when N>0.
- [ ] AC-3 (FR-02, D-List, W3) Modal "Limit jury access — Round: <round name>" + help text; lists the Attachments group (D-Pitch) then each form (main form first, then round forms) → sections → fields in form order; each row: checkbox, Q-number (running per pop-up), label (truncated, full text in `title`), answer type, file icon for `file_upload`/`image_upload`/`video_upload`.
- [ ] AC-4 (FR-03, FR-04, W3) Multi-select; keyword search filters rows as typed; Select all / Clear all act on rows currently shown by the search; section checkbox tri-state (indeterminate when partially hidden).
- [ ] AC-5 (FR-05) Live counter "X of Y questions hidden from jury" (Y = listed rows incl. system rows).
- [ ] AC-6 (FR-06, W4c) Save disabled until a change; Cancel discards. Save replaces the round's hidden set atomically (transaction), writes one audit row (D-Audit), refreshes the unreviewed snapshot, and shows toast "Access updated. N questions hidden from jurors in <round>." with "View activity" link.
- [ ] AC-7 (BR-02, W4b) If every listed question is ticked: inline error "At least one question must stay visible to jurors. Untick one or more questions to save."; Save disabled; server rejects the same case.
- [ ] AC-8 (D-Child) Rows whose visibility depends on a ticked row show "Also hidden — depends on Qn" and are counted in the juror-side effect (not in the ticked count).
- [ ] AC-9 (FR-13, D-Prev) "Copy from previous round" pre-ticks the previous round's keys that still exist; disabled with tooltip when there is no previous round; nothing saved until Save.
- [ ] AC-10 (BR-07) A new round, and every existing round at deploy, has nothing hidden.
- [ ] AC-11 (BR-03 deferred, D-Rubric) No "Used in scoring" tag / warning in R1 — documented in the module spec as a known gap.

**Juror view — W5**
- [ ] AC-12 (FR-08, D-Which, D-Child, D-Section) For a juror in round R, hidden fields, their dependent children, and fully-hidden sections are **absent** from `round-applications` (main + round forms), including the reviewer `previewOnly` iframe (D-Reviewers). Not greyed out; no placeholder.
- [ ] AC-13 (FR-09, NFR-01, NFR-02) Hidden keys are removed from the answer data **before** `formatFormSubmissionsData()`; no presigned URL, ImageKit URL, file name or answer for a hidden key appears anywhere in the HTML response (incl. HTML comments) or in `$tpl->record['data']` (stripped). Verified by grepping the rendered page for each hidden key's S3 object key and answer value.
- [ ] AC-14 (D-Pitch) When `__pitch_deck` / `__power_pitch_video` is hidden, the pitch-deck block (template :488-526, incl. the commented PDF link :491) / Power Pitch iframe (:471-476) are not rendered and no URL for them is generated.
- [ ] AC-15 (FR-11, W5) When ≥1 question is hidden in round R, one neutral banner "Some application fields have been restricted by the program manager." at the top of the application; no titles or counts.
- [ ] AC-16 (FR-12, BRD §9) Saving a change applies on the juror's next page load; draft ratings and jury-question answers already entered are untouched.
- [ ] AC-17 (BRD §9) Same juror in two rounds: each round's set applies independently.
- [ ] AC-18 (D-Fail, NFR-07) Forced query failure on the hidden-set lookup → error message, zero answers rendered.
- [ ] AC-19 (D-TTL) In jury context, `file_upload` presigned URLs expire in ≤15 min.
- [ ] AC-20 (D-Block, FR-09/FR-10) A jury-role session (juror and reviewer) gets a redirect / 403 on every route in finding 9, including each POST action listed; admin/PM behaviour unchanged.

**Admin visibility — W1, W6**
- [ ] AC-21 (FR-14, W1) Kanban round header and tableview round tab show a lock badge "N hidden from jury" when N>0; amber "N hidden · M new questions not reviewed" when M>0 (D-Unreviewed). Clicking opens Round Settings → Jury allotment with the pop-up open.
- [ ] AC-22 (FR-15, BRD §9) Admin, PM and partner views (application detail, Kanban, exports) always show every answer.
- [ ] AC-23 (FR-16, US-05, W6a) "Activity" view on the Jury allotment tab lists, newest first: date/time (IST), user, Hid/Unhid, questions (labels), sourced from `spa_admin_logs` `module='jury_visibility'` for this round; CSV export (NFR-04) audit-logged.
- [ ] AC-24 (BR-08, US-03, W6b, D-Closed) When the programme is closed (`program_closed = 1`), the pop-up opens read-only (checkboxes disabled, Save removed, banner "Programme closed. Access settings are read-only." — no close date exists to print), and the save handler rejects writes server-side.
- [ ] AC-25 (BRD §9) Deleting a question from the form: its row stays in the table but is ignored (not listed, not counted); the audit trail is unchanged.
- [ ] AC-26 (UI/UX Should) "Preview as juror" opens the first application in the round through the jury rendering path with the **saved** hidden set, read-only (no rating/answer actions). Hidden if the round has no applications.

**Non-functional**
- [ ] AC-27 (NFR-06) Pop-up data for a 200-field form loads < 1.5 s; jury page adds one indexed query (`round_id`).
- [ ] AC-28 (NFR-08) Every new query filters by `round_id` + `program_id` on the per-tenant `$database`; never `$mainDatabase`.
- [ ] AC-29 (BR-06, D3) No applicant-facing change; submitted data never modified.
- [ ] AC-30 (D-Flag) Flag off: no button, badge, pop-up or activity view; config handlers return 403 JSON. Flag switched off after rows exist: jurors still do not see the hidden questions.
- [ ] AC-31 (invariant #1) `limit_jury_access_enabled` present, same snake_case string, in tenants entity + `global.service.ts` field lists, backend `Feature` enum, frontend `IFeatures`, admin `config.php`; `/trace-flag` reports no orphans.

## Data model

Backend owns schema (`synchronize:true`, `BE/core/database/database.module.ts:32`). No FKs (zenxai / FA-010 precedent).

**New table `application_program_round_jury_hidden_fields`** (entity `ApplicationProgramRoundJuryHiddenFieldsEntity` in `BE/modules/application-management/entities/`):
`id` PK · `program_id` int · `round_id` int · `form_id` int (0 for system rows) · `field_key` varchar(64) · `created_by` int (admin user id) · `created_at`.
Unique `(round_id, form_id, field_key)`; index `(round_id)`. Replace-on-save = delete round's rows + insert, in one transaction.

> Departure from the BRD's suggested `round_question_visibility` (§12): no `tenant_id` (one DB per tenant — invariant #5), int ids (not UUID — matches the schema), no `is_hidden_from_jury` boolean (row presence = hidden; the BRD explicitly allows adapting names).

**`application_program_rounds` + 3 nullable columns:**
- `jury_visibility_reviewed_keys` JSON — snapshot of listed keys at last save (D-Unreviewed).
- `jury_visibility_updated_at` datetime, `jury_visibility_updated_by` int — for the button/badge and W6 without scanning logs.

**Audit:** `spa_admin_logs`, `module='jury_visibility'` (D-Audit). The BRD's `visibility_audit_log` table is not created.

## Per-repo plan

Dependency order: tenants → backend → frontend → admin. (The D-Block issue in admin has no dependency and ships first.)

### tenants
- `TenantUsersEntity` boolean column `limit_jury_access_enabled`, default false, after `tripura_certificate_theme_enabled` (`src/modules/tenants/entities/tenant-users.entity.ts:2417`).
- Add it to **all three hand-maintained field lists** in `src/modules/global/global.service.ts` — the select list (beside :339), the response mapping (beside :690-691) and the settings list (beside :937). Precedent: `operational_cost_reimbursement_enabled` at :335, :686-687, :933. A column alone does not reach the API.
- Operators switch it on per tenant from `sanchiconnect-saas-tenants-admin`'s generic edit page over `tenant_users`. `[INFERRED — requires validation]` that the column appears there without a `spa_data_management` metadata row; if not, add the row (data, not code).
- Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm test`; call `verify_tenant` on staging and see the field.

### backend
- New entity `ApplicationProgramRoundJuryHiddenFieldsEntity` registered in the application-management module; 3 new columns on `ApplicationProgramRoundsEntity` (beside FA-010's `nda_*` at :153-177). All nullable/defaulted, no backfill.
- Add `LIMIT_JURY_ACCESS_ENABLED = 'limit_jury_access_enabled'` to the `Feature` enum (`core/constants/enum.ts`, beside :1258) for parity — no backend guard needed (backend serves no juror data).
- No routes, DTOs, services. Update `src/modules/application-management/module.spec.md` (owns: new table + columns; consumer: sc-saas-admin via Medoo).
- Verify: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm test`; boot against a staging DB copy and confirm `synchronize` adds exactly the new table/columns.

### frontend
- One optional boolean `limit_jury_access_enabled?: boolean` in `IFeatures` (`src/app/core/domain/brand.model.ts`), for invariant #1 parity only. No UI. Verify: `ng build`/lint.

### admin
- **New `includes/jury_visibility_functions.php`** (included beside `jury_nda_functions.php`):
  - `juryVisibilitySchemaReady($db)` — probe (D-Fail).
  - `juryVisibilityListQuestions($db, $programId, $roundId)` — forms per D-List via `getFormDetails()`; returns groups/sections/rows with key, label, type, file flag, `visiblity.field` parent, Q-number.
  - `juryHiddenFieldsForRound($db, $programId, $roundId)` → `[form_id => [field_key,…]]`, `[]` if none, **`false` on error**.
  - `juryHiddenClosure($formD, $hiddenKeys)` — transitive dependants (D-Child).
  - `juryApplyHiddenFields(&$formD, &$data, $hiddenKeys)` — strips from `$formD` sections/`fields`/`main_fields`/`file_fields`/`image_fields`/`video_fields`, drops emptied sections, strips `$data` top-level keys and keys inside every multi-value row.
  - `juryVisibilitySave(...)` — CSRF + `juryNdaManageScope()` + not-closed + BR-02 + transaction + snapshot + `juryVisibilityAudit()`.
  - `juryVisibilityCounts($db, $round)` — hidden + unreviewed counts for Kanban/button.
- **Jury view** `modules/jury/round-applications.php`: after the round/allotment checks, load the hidden set once (fail closed); inside the loop at :818-845 call `juryApplyHiddenFields()` **before** `formatFormSubmissionsData()` (:839); strip `$tpl->record['data']` (:723-727, :869); skip pitch deck (:1096-1106) and Power Pitch (:833-835) when system keys hidden; set `$tpl->juryFieldsRestricted`. Lower `file_upload` presign TTL to 15 min in jury context (pass TTL into `formatFileFields`; default unchanged for admin callers).
- **Jury template** `themes/default/html/jury/round-applications.php`: FR-11 banner at top of the application panel. No other template change needed (it iterates the already-filtered definition, :337-448).
- **Round Settings** `modules/application_management/edit_program_round.php` + theme (jury_allotment block, theme :449+): button + helper line (W2); modal (W3/W4) following `#juryNdaReminderModal`; handlers `submitAction=jury_visibility_load | jury_visibility_save | jury_visibility_copy_previous | jury_visibility_activity | jury_visibility_activity_csv | jury_visibility_preview`. Do **not** copy the legacy toggle handlers (:389-574) — they lack CSRF and scoping.
- **Kanban**: `fetchProgramData()` adds `jury_hidden_count`, `jury_unreviewed_count`; badge in `kanban-applications.js` `build_titles()` (:106) and in the tableview tab (:484-491). The `getProgramRounds` AJAX handler runs before the page's PM/partner scoping (:705 vs :1456-1500) — counts only, no question labels, so no new exposure; noted in Risks.
- **D-Block (OQ-4)**: jury-role (and reviewer) redirect/403 at the top of `application-submission-detail.php`, `application_management/form-submission-detail.php`, `submission-application-management.php`, `submission-application-management-tableview.php`, `application_management/analysis_form.php` — **before** any POST handler.
- **Flag (D-Flag):** `config/config.php` constant `limit_jury_access_enabled` defined from `$getDatabaseSettingsFromMainTable["limit_jury_access_enabled"] ?? "0"` (pattern :119-123); gate button, badges, pop-up, activity and every `jury_visibility_*` handler on it. The jury-side filter is **not** flag-gated.
- **Read-only (D-Closed):** load `application_programs.program_closed` with the round; when `1`, render the pop-up read-only and reject `jury_visibility_save` / `jury_visibility_copy_previous` server-side.
- **Reviewers (D-Reviewers):** apply the filter on the `round-applications` path regardless of `checkIfJuryisReviewer()` (the reviewer exemptions at :32-34 and :706-708 are for allotment, not for this filter).
- Module specs: update `modules/jury/module.spec.md`, `modules/application_management/module.spec.md`; refresh `specs/admin-module-specs-index.md`.
- Mind the jury session-key trap (`admin_roles` plural/singular, `modules/jury/module.spec.md:245-249`) and `// ` comments are forbidden in this repo (use `/* */`, incl. `<script>` blocks).
- Verify: `php -l` on every edited file; CLI harness for `juryApplyHiddenFields()` / `juryHiddenClosure()` over: flat field, file field, multi-value sub-field, conditional child, chained child, fully-hidden section, deleted key, system keys; manual matrix (Test plan).

## Contracts & invariants

- **API:** none added or changed (D-NoAPI). `/audit-contract` not required for routes; run it anyway only if the backend diff touches a controller/DTO (it should not).
- **Flags:** `limit_jury_access_enabled` (D-Flag), owned by tenants → backend `Feature` enum → frontend `IFeatures` → admin `config.php`. `/trace-flag` is a blocking gate before `in-review`.
- **Schema contract:** backend entity ↔ admin Medoo reads/writes; never rename after release.
- **Invariants at risk:** #4 Auth — new admin handlers must check role + scope + CSRF, juror path must fail closed, D-Block closes an existing jury-role leak. #5 Tenant scoping — per-tenant `$database` only; `/check-isolation` on every new query. #1 Flags — new flag, propagated to all four places. #3 Tenant-verification shape — **additive** field in the `verify_tenant` / `tenant-settings` response; existing consumers ignore unknown fields. #2, #6 untouched.

## Cross-Repo Contract Impact

| Item | Owner | Consumers | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| New table + 3 round columns | backend (`synchronize:true`) | sc-saas-admin (Medoo) | `/check-isolation`; deploy backend first |
| `spa_admin_logs` `module='jury_visibility'` | admin | `system_logs/list.php` (hard-coded action filter list `:209` — add the new actions) | none |
| Flag `limit_jury_access_enabled` | tenants | backend enum, frontend `IFeatures`, admin `config.php` | `/trace-flag` |
| `verify_tenant` / `tenant-settings` response (+1 field) | tenants | backend bootstrap, frontend `brand.model.ts` (additive) | `/trace-flag` |
| 3rdparty, ai-startups-analyzer | — | none | — |
| tenants-admin | — | none in code; operator toggles the column | — |

## Edge cases (BRD §9 mapped to the code)

- **Form edited after save:** new field keys are visible by default and counted as unreviewed (D-Unreviewed). Label/order edits keep keys.
- **Field duplicated in the form builder:** the copy gets a **new key** (`edit-form.php:3548,3712`) → visible by default, shows as unreviewed. Visibility rules on a copied child still point at the original parent key.
- **Form blob replaced** (`importFieldsFromForm` `modules/form-management/edit-form.php:456-488`, dev `uploadFieldsJson` :510-575, version restore `versions.php:29-76`): keys may change → previously hidden questions become visible. Mitigation: they appear as unreviewed and the badge turns amber; documented in the help text. `[INFERRED — requires validation]` against a real import.
- **Field deleted:** row ignored (AC-25).
- **Hidden mid-evaluation / unhidden:** next load (AC-16).
- **Juror who is also a PM:** not applicable in this codebase — a user has exactly one admin role (`admin_role_id`), so an account is either the jury role or a PM role, never both.
- **Comments / discussion threads:** out of scope (BRD).
- **Admin bulk export:** unaffected (AC-22).

## Risks & residual gaps

1. **Public ImageKit URLs** for `image_upload`/`video_upload` answers never expire (`generateS3FileUrl`). Hiding a question stops *new* issuance; a URL a juror saw before the question was hidden stays valid. Same for the pitch-deck slides. Fix needs private delivery for these objects — follow-up, not R1.
2. **Pre-issued 7-day presigned URLs** (before deploy / before hiding) remain valid until expiry.
3. **Google Docs viewer**: with brand `enable_file_viewer` on, presigned URLs are passed to `docs.google.com/gview` (`themes/default/html/elements/footer.php:452-471`) — third-party receipt of visible files; pre-existing, unchanged.
4. **Jury reviewers bypass allotment** across programmes (`round-applications.php:32-34,706-708`; no partner scoping). Pre-existing; the filter still applies to whatever they open (D-Reviewers). Follow-up issue.
5. **Unscoped AJAX on the Kanban page** (`getProgramRounds` etc. run before PM/partner scoping). Pre-existing; this feature adds counts only.
6. **FA-010 gate resolver mismatch**: `juryNdaResolveRoute` (`jury_nda_functions.php:524-547`) treats the `application-submission-detail/{id}` id as a `forms_submissions` id; it is an `application_program_submission_rounds` row id. Moot for jurors once D-Block ships; file as an FA-010 follow-up.
7. **Free-text leakage**: sensitive data typed into a visible question, or inside the pitch deck, is not redacted (BRD §14 risk, accepted).
8. **Developer SQL tools** can edit the hidden-set table and `spa_admin_logs` (FA-010 D-Immut residual).

## Test plan

**Automated test-first coverage is BLOCKED workspace-wide** (no "guardian" skill; workspace CLAUDE.md step 6). Each Linear issue must state "automated test-first coverage was not added" and use:
- **backend:** `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm test`; schema diff on a staging copy.
- **admin:** `php -l` on every touched file; CLI harness for `juryApplyHiddenFields()` / `juryHiddenClosure()` (cases listed in Per-repo plan); **manual juror matrix** with real sessions: (a) juror in round R with Q-file, Q-image, Q-multi-value-subfield, Q-parent-of-child, pitch deck hidden → view-source has none of the answers, S3 keys, ImageKit paths, labels; banner shown; (b) juror in round R' (nothing hidden) → unchanged; (c) reviewer via `previewOnly` iframe; (d) forced DB error → fail closed; (e) table absent → feature unavailable, jury view unchanged; (f) D-Block: every route/action in finding 9 as juror and reviewer → redirect/403, as admin/PM → unchanged; (g) config as PM not in `program_managers`, as partner on another partner's programme, without CSRF token → 403; (h) BR-02 server-side; (i) `program_closed=1` → read-only + server rejects; (m) flag off → no config UI + handlers 403, existing hidden rows still enforced; (j) Kanban/tableview badges incl. amber state after adding a field to the form; (k) Copy from previous round; (l) audit rows + CSV.
- **tenants:** `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm test`; `verify_tenant` shows the field.
- **frontend:** `ng build` + lint.
- **cross-repo:** tenants → backend → frontend → admin on staging; `/trace-flag limit_jury_access_enabled`, `/check-isolation`, `/cross-repo-review` before `in-review`.

## Rollout

0. **D-Block first** — standalone admin security fix, no schema or flag dependency (own Urgent issue). `[CONFIRMED — OQ-4]`
1. **Tenants**: flag column (default off) + field lists. Additive; nobody reads it yet.
2. **Backend**: `Feature` enum + additive schema. Old admin ignores it.
3. **Frontend**: `IFeatures` type only; can ship any time after 1.
4. **Admin**: tolerant of an undeployed backend (D-Fail probe) and of a missing flag column (`?? "0"`). Nothing hidden anywhere at deploy (BR-07).
5. **Pilot**: switch the flag on for one tenant, use it on one live programme round (BRD §15 step 4), then enable for all tenants. Help article / security collateral are business tasks, not code.

## Linear breakdown (created 2026-10-06)

Project **Enhancement** (P-SAN-48), milestone **Limit Jury Access**. Every task is assigned to **Sandeep**, status Todo. Each task covers exactly one repo, shown by its `Repo:` label. 8 parent tasks, 36 subtasks. (A standalone project P-SAN-77 was created first, then moved to Canceled when the user asked for a milestone inside Enhancement instead.)

## Delivery process (the standing 10-step loop)

| Step | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Orient on the BRD / issue | done |
| 2 | `/from-linear`: full loop, not `/bug-fix` (4 repos, new table, flag) | done |
| 3 | Spec drafted with file:line evidence | done (this file) |
| 4 | Design questions resolved; approved by Nirmal | **done 2026-10-06** (OQ-1..4) |
| 5 | Contract checks: `/trace-flag limit_jury_access_enabled`, `/check-isolation`, `/cross-repo-review` | not run; built into SAN-1691, SAN-1695, SAN-1698, SAN-1711 and SAN-1719 |
| 6 | Tests first: blocked (no guardian skill). Substitutes are tsc/lint/build/test for Node repos, and `php -l` + CLI harness (SAN-1700) + manual matrices (SAN-1688, SAN-1707, SAN-1714) for admin | not started |
| 7 | Branch: none, work directly on `ai_native_setup` | n/a |
| 8 | Implement in the order above; Linear states move as the work happens | not started |
| 9 | Verify with real output; update module specs + indexes | not started |
| 10 | Commit and push to `ai_native_setup` only after Nirmal confirms each diff; close the issues | not started |

## Out of scope

Per-juror / per-panel sets (D2); partial masking; redaction inside documents; applicant-side marking/notice (D3); form-builder confidential tag (D1); mentors/sponsors (D5); restriction templates FR-17 (Could — deferred); rubric-linked warning BR-03 (D-Rubric, until a criterion↔question link exists); legacy/mentor/individual/VS jury rounds (D-Scope); private delivery for ImageKit image/video (Risk 1); juror PDF export and juror AI summary (do not exist — D-Export/AI).

## Open questions

None. OQ-1..OQ-4 were answered by Nirmal on 2026-10-06:

| # | Question | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| OQ-1 | Tenant feature flag? | **Yes**, `limit_jury_access_enabled`, default off (D-Flag). Overrides the recommendation of "no flag". |
| OQ-2 | What is "evaluation closed" (BR-08)? | **Reuse programme `program_closed`** (D-Closed). |
| OQ-3 | Restrict jury users flagged `is_jury_reviewer` too? | **Yes** (D-Reviewers) — same existing jury role, no new role. |
| OQ-4 | Block jurors from the admin data pages? | **Yes, shipped first as its own Urgent issue** (D-Block). |

Approved by Nirmal on 2026-10-06. The remaining `[DECIDED — recommended default]` rows (D-List, D-Child, D-Rubric, D-Pitch, D-TTL, etc.) stand unless overridden.
