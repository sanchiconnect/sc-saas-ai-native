# SanchiSaaS — Workspace AGENTS.md

Last updated: 2026-07-14

A framework-agnostic conventions file for anyone — human or AI agent — working across this poly-repo. This
is workspace-level and different in scope from any single repo's own `AGENTS.md`: it covers what's true
*across* the seven repos, not the conventions specific to one. Read the workspace `CLAUDE.md` first (the
constitution); this file is a tighter, task-oriented companion to it. `[AS-IS]` unless tagged.

---

## 1. The poly-repo rule

Seven independently-versioned, independently-deployed Git repos, each with its own `.git`, dependencies,
and deploy pipeline. **Never assume an atomic cross-repo change.** A change spanning two or more repos must
be coordinated and staged in dependency order — the blast-radius order (`tenants → backend →
{frontend, admin}`, with `ai-startups-analyzer` and `sc-saas-3rdparty-webservices` as leaf nodes in the
outbound direction) is the right default staging order, but see §3 below before trusting it as complete.

No repo in this workspace has Docker, CI/CD, or infra-as-code — deployment is manual/ops-run everywhere,
confirmed independently in every repo's own `design.md`. This raises the cost of an uncoordinated change:
there is no CI gate that would catch a cross-repo break before it reaches production.

---

## 2. Cross-repo invariants (from the workspace CLAUDE.md — restated here for a fast reference)

1. **Flag names are owned by `tenants`** (`TenantUsersEntity` boolean columns, 218 of them — 217 genuine feature flags plus one status field). The
   snake_case column name is the contract string everywhere. Propagate add/rename/remove to: backend
   `Feature` enum, frontend `IFeatures`, admin `config.php` constants. Use `/trace-flag` first. Note: the
   `verify_tenant` endpoint exposes flags via a **hand-maintained** `.select()` + object-literal (two manual
   edits per new flag); `tenant-settings` exposes them via **reflection** over every boolean column (one
   edit). These are not the same mechanism — a `/trace-flag` check against one does not confirm the other.
2. **The API contract is owned by `sc-saas-backend`** (controllers + class-validator DTOs, `api/v{n}`).
   Check any controller/DTO change against: frontend `core/service/*`, `sc-saas-admin`'s cURL/Guzzle
   callers, **and `sanchiconnect-saas-tenants-admin`'s cURL callers** (a third, newly-confirmed consumer —
   see §5 below). Use `/audit-contract`.
3. **The tenant-verification contract is owned by `tenants`** — but it is **two different routes for two
   different consumers**, not one contract: `sc-saas-backend`'s bootstrap depends on `tenant-settings`;
   `sc-saas-frontend`'s app-init depends on `verify_tenant`. They use different hostname-matching logic
   (substring vs. effectively-exact `LIKE`) and different flag-exposure mechanisms (see #1). A change that
   passes a smoke test against one consumer can still break the other.
4. **Auth is JWT** — but verify which mechanism actually applies before assuming uniformity:
   `sc-saas-backend` issues it via an httpOnly cookie (Bearer fallback); `sc-saas-frontend` actually reads
   it from that cookie, **not** from localStorage as its own `CLAUDE.md` currently (incorrectly) states;
   `sanchiconnect-saas-tenants` has **no JWT/session concept of its own at all** despite storing the
   `single_session_login_enabled` flag column on behalf of the backend; `sc-saas-3rdparty-webservices` has
   **no auth of any kind** on any endpoint (network-trust only); the two PHP admin panels use session-based
   RBAC, not JWT, with JWT constants defined-but-unused in both.
5. **Tenant scoping rule per repo** — and this is genuinely four different mechanisms, not one rule with
   four implementations (see `design.md` §1 for the full architectural statement): `tenants` filters by
   `domain`; `sc-saas-backend` relies on one-deployment-per-tenant with no per-query guard at all (a
   `domain` column exists on some entities but is never used as a query filter — it's a denormalized label
   for cross-tenant HTTP consumers); `sc-saas-admin` resolves a fresh per-tenant DB connection per request;
   `sanchiconnect-saas-tenants-admin` has **no tenant-scoping mechanism at all** (a stripped fork of
   `sc-saas-admin` with that logic deliberately disabled) except one leaf route (`modules/scrapper.php`)
   that reintroduces it ad hoc for cross-tenant reporting. Use `/check-isolation`.

---

## 3. Known cross-repo drift to watch for (six threads — see `knowledge.md` for the full narrative)

1. **AI-Credits schema has three independent direct mutators** (`sanchiconnect-saas-tenants` owns the
   schema and purchase-side; `sc-saas-admin`'s PHP owns reserve/settle/refund/debit; `sanchiconnect-saas-tenants-admin`'s
   PHP does direct admin CRUD on the same tables) — with no shared schema-versioning mechanism between any
   of the three. Before changing any `ai_credit_*` column, check all three codebases, not just the schema
   owner. See `database.md` §3.
2. **The documented call graph has three confirmed-wrong edges**: `sc-saas-3rdparty-webservices` is not
   "backend-only" (`sc-saas-admin` calls it directly, one route with no auth header);
   `sanchiconnect-saas-tenants-admin` is not "fully standalone" (it calls `sc-saas-backend` directly on
   every tenant edit); `sc-saas-admin` has undocumented direct edges to both the gateway and to
   `sanchiconnect-saas-tenants` itself (an Easebuzz webhook, routed outside its own dispatcher). See `api.md`'s
   real-call-graph table before assuming a repo's own "who calls me" section is exhaustive.
3. **Three tenancy models plus one stripped fork coexist** — do not carry one mental model of "tenant
   scoping" between repos. See §2 point 5 above and `design.md` §1.
4. **Security findings worth checking before touching adjacent code**: `verify_tenant`/`tenant-settings`
   plaintext-secret exposure (already known); per-tenant DB passwords in plaintext, now also read directly
   by `sanchiconnect-saas-tenants-admin`'s `scrapper.php`; hardcoded live API keys in
   `sanchiconnect-saas-tenants` seed data; plaintext OAuth secrets in `sc-saas-backend`'s
   `PaymentGatewaysEntity` (a working `CryptoService` exists but isn't used there); an unauthenticated
   Adminer console with an embedded live DB password in `sanchiconnect-saas-tenants-admin`; zero
   authentication anywhere in `sc-saas-3rdparty-webservices`; five of six sampled AJAX handlers in
   `sanchiconnect-saas-tenants-admin` skip the login check entirely. See `knowledge.md` §6 for the full list
   with citations — do not reproduce any of the underlying secret literals when referencing these.
5. **`synchronize: true` with no migrations is present in every NestJS repo**, not a one-off
   (`sanchiconnect-saas-tenants`, `sc-saas-backend`). Any entity change in either is a live, irreversible
   schema change on next deploy with no migration to revert — be deliberate, and re-read §1's finding before
   assuming a schema change is "just" a code change.
6. **No Docker, CI/CD, or infra-as-code anywhere in the workspace** — there is no automated gate that would
   catch any of the above before it reaches production. Manual coordination is the only safety net that
   exists today.

## 4. Specs and workspace commands

Work is driven by specs (`specs/features/<id>-<slug>.spec.md`, `<repo>/src/<module>/module.spec.md`), not
ad-hoc prompts — see workspace `CLAUDE.md` for the full flow (`/spec-new` → author → approve →
`/spec-implement`). Before opening a cross-repo PR, run the relevant gate command
(`/trace-flag`, `/audit-contract`, `/check-isolation`, `/cross-repo-review`) — and, given §3 point 2 above,
do not trust a repo's own "who calls me" documentation as the full list of callers when running these; cross-
check `api.md`'s real-call-graph table too.

## Change Log

- 2026-07-14 | Initial workspace-level AGENTS.md. Restated the workspace CLAUDE.md's five cross-repo
  invariants with the specific corrections/nuances each one's per-repo knowledge.md pass surfaced (the
  two-different-routes nature of the tenant-verification contract, the four-way tenancy-model split, the
  non-uniform auth model). Added the six known-drift threads as a tight reference so a future agent doesn't
  have to rediscover them from scratch.
